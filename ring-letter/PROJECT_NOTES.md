# Ring letter MVP

Mobile-first anonymous story reading and submissions. Vinext + D1. All sample stories are marked AI fiction. Only author-consented, manually approved submissions are publicly readable. No AI API calls, messaging, or external analytics.

Public users receive a 30-day HttpOnly random session cookie; only its SHA-256 hash is stored. Losing this cookie loses self-service access. User records are excluded after 30 days, and expired rows are purged when a new session is created. No background cleanup guarantee. Limits are per session, not a bot-defense guarantee.

Admin access is checked on the server using the platform-verified owner email. Owner signs in via Sites ChatGPT sign-in. If ownership changes, update the server-only ADMIN constant. Anonymous sessions can submit at most 5 stories and 100 feedback events per day. Private stories cannot be approved. No admin text editing: changed author consent would otherwise be needed.

Browser QA and API checks are local. tests/api.mjs uses synthetic trusted admin headers ONLY against local preview; never enable any header-spoofing convenience route in production. Test stories are removed after tests.

Before wider release: add stronger abuse prevention, recoverable author identity if needed, scoped reviewer membership, explicit retention jobs, an operations contact, and a real author content library. Readership is not automatically measured: feedback counts are events, not unique people or retention.

## Human cross-time matching pilot (2026-11-05)

The home page and default reading experience use components/match-experience.tsx and data/matching.ts, with no API requests, cookies, database writes, matching algorithm, or third-party analytics. Existing legacy submissions/database are retained; footer links explicitly expose prior submissions/withdrawal and the prior public inbox. Never reuse old consent for the new manual matching process.

Update FORM_URL_DISTRESS and FORM_URL_ECHO at the top of data/matching.ts to activate external forms. Both currently equal '#'; clicking them shows an unavailable message, not a fake submission. Forms should supply the contact/removal path mentioned in the UI, separately collect receiving-match consent and future de-identified reuse consent, and identify the letter being echoed. Echo does not automatically send to an author.

MATCH_LETTERS holds eight fictional samples (two per SCENARIOS category). Replace id, scenario, year, situation, matchReason and body; set isExample=false only for consented, reviewed, de-identified real letters. These bundled letters are publicly readable; do not place confidential source originals here. Keep at least two letters per scenario for the next-letter interaction. Match reasons are authored copy, not computed personalization.

Browser QA: all four scenario buttons opened their first letter and next switched to the second letter in the same scenario. Both '#' form links displayed explicit unavailable notices; event attributes were verified. Home and reader had no horizontal/text overflow at 320, 390, 768, 1024, 1440 CSS pixels. TypeScript and production build passed. Data-event hooks are present only; there is no persistent event count yet.

## Restored submission entry and random reading

Main navigation, hero, and reader now lead to the original working writing form. Both past and present submission modes and My fragments remain available. Matching registration is a secondary expandable entry and does not implicitly enroll site submissions. Reader opens a random sample immediately; next chooses another without immediate repeats. Scenario controls are optional and collapsed by default. No timed automatic changes. Browser verified random transitions, optional filter, and opening the present form; API regression covers both submission modes, permissions and cleanup.


## MVP feedback loop (2026-11-09)

The current reader now saves explicit reactions and, only after a voluntary checkbox, read_view/read_next events to the existing feedback table. No new database, schema migration, third-party analytics, login or payment flow. Consent lasts for this page session and can be turned off; read_view means rendered, not finished reading. Counters are events, not people or retention. The earlier no-API/local-only reader notes describe v4 and are superseded here. Ordinary reading still creates no session and saves no reading events before opt-in.

components/experience-feedback.tsx supplies shared consent, durable submission and a collapsed short website feedback form (category required; visit purpose, life situation and a 300-character message optional). The navigation's 使用回饋 opens it directly, on all public views including writing success. Structured site feedback is private to the owner; it is not a letter or an echo. Error messages preserve form content. Session creation is shared between concurrent read/reaction sends. Removing all browser data resets feedback consent.

The authenticated 管理信箱 shows 30-day aggregate event totals separately for sample/real letters, writing attempts/completions and recent text/reaction feedback (last 300 events, not all records). Public requests cannot retrieve feedback. Aggregates honor the same 30-day cutoff and full erasure. Unknown letters, malformed surveys and missing new-flow consent are rejected. Samples cannot establish effectiveness of real matching or willingness to pay. Existing matching/echo external forms remain unconfigured (#).

Validation: TypeScript and production build; expanded local API test for explicit consent, sample reactions, valid/invalid site feedback, private aggregates and erasure, plus original submission/moderation regression. Browser QA covers consent gating, durable reaction/survey success, random next, and responsive layout.
